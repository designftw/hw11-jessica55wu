		The problem my chat app aims to address is that standard audio messaging features are pretty barebones, and
		users aren't always able to process audio messages quickly, efficiently, or at all, in certain scenarios.
		From user research, I learned that people had trouble listening to voice messages at certain recurring times,
		such as in a quiet area (classroom, work, etc.), and that they wanted to be able to process these voice
		messages more quickly (not have to spend a couple minutes, per se, listening to a particularly long voice
		message).
	</p>

	<p>
		Besides implementing all the standard features of PM (sending text, images, searching contacts, liking
		messages, etc.), the main design differences are 1) the addition of in-browser audio functionality that allow
		users to record and send voice messages and 2) the addition of chat transcription technology (via the OpenAI
		Whisper model). Voice messages that are sent and received are automatically transcribed, so the recipient can
		use the text to process the message or as a guide to follow along in scenarios where it is difficult to
		understand the audio message by ear.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the backend, this is done through obtaining the user's audio stream, setting up a media recorder to capture
		the audio in the WebM format, and storing the recorded audio chunks. Similar to the images, this is eventually
		stored as an audio blob. Upon sending, an API I put up on Heroku is pinged with the audio (since the Graffiti
		server doesn't support a lot of in-browser audio functionality there isn't proper node package support, so I
		can't directly ping the OpenAI API). This returns a promise, which then resolves with the transcription.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note: I can't directly show my Heroku app code,
		so I've copied it into a folder here (with private API keys removed) called heroku-code,
		if that is helpful for evaluation.
		Thanks!
