		Next week, I plan to add the transcription features on top of the audio. This involves a preview that can expand
		into a larger view of the audio message transcribed, and I'll use some web API in order to actually do the text
		transcription.

		This is largely similar to the functionality I originally planned, but there are some differences.
		For one, I am not adding any sort of file system that makes it easy for users to search for existing audio
		files or image files. I'll focus on the main value add of having better audio playback and text transcription,
		which was what I found to be the most important from user research,
		and also fix any bugs that are currently on my app. There are also a couple usability, efficiency, and learnability
		changes I have in mind that I will implement.

		This week, I added the functionality to be able to send and receive audio messages, including the
		recording of the audio, the storage in the server, and then being able to display said audio with very
		basic playback in chat message history. This was exactly what was discussed as an appropriate halfway point,
		and on top of that, I fixed existing bugs on last week's functionalities and made some learnability
		and usability improvements.

		Small side note: I think I might have some code in the wrong places here, but my app is a little inconsistent
		with loading usernames and I haven't totally figured out why - sometimes it might take a refresh or two (or hard
		refresh) for everything to come up, but usually it is okay. :')
